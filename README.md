# Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-Project

This project demonstrates the application of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques on a pre-trained DistilBERT model using the IMDb dataset for sentiment analysis. By leveraging the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique, we aim to efficiently fine-tune the model with minimal computational resources.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the following:
1. **Loading and Evaluating a Foundation Model**: Establishing a baseline performance by evaluating the pre-trained DistilBERT model.
2. **Performing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Implementing the LoRA technique to fine-tune the model.
3. **Performing Inference with a PEFT Model**: Evaluating the fine-tuned model and comparing its performance with the baseline.

## Project Structure

- `LightweightFineTuningProject.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete workflow, including loading the model, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, setup instructions, and observations.
- `.gitignore`: File specifying untracked files and directories.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required packages for the project.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11 or higher**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. **Virtual Environment (Optional)**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-Project.git
   cd Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-Project

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Jupyter Notebook**:

   Ensure you have Jupyter installed and run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LightweightFineTuningProject.ipynb

## Usage
- `Open the Notebook`: Launch the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells in sequence.
